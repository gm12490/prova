<i>[Episode 13]</i>

3
00:01:21,830 --> 00:01:24,160
- I'll be back.
- I'll be back.

4
00:03:39,350 --> 00:03:41,050
Ri Hwan, wait.

5
00:03:45,080 --> 00:03:47,130
Ri Hwan, wait!

6
00:04:11,060 --> 00:04:12,150
Are you okay?

7
00:04:17,220 --> 00:04:18,400
What about you?

8
00:04:19,300 --> 00:04:20,640
Are you okay?

9
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:24,440
I'm fine.

10
00:04:25,160 --> 00:04:27,540
I haven't broken up with you.

11
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:31,790
But you've broken up with me.

12
00:04:36,490 --> 00:04:37,840
Ri Hwan.

13
00:04:40,350 --> 00:04:44,350
If you do this, we have to start
from the beginning again.

14
00:04:44,890 --> 00:04:47,180
We have to cry from the beginning again.

15
00:04:48,490 --> 00:04:49,830
Don't you understand that?

16
00:04:49,830 --> 00:04:52,480
I didn't know that you were coming today.

17
00:04:52,480 --> 00:04:55,170
I didn't ask to meet you today.

18
00:04:55,170 --> 00:04:58,570
If he called you because of your mom,
can't we just go inside?

19
00:04:58,900 --> 00:05:00,220
Let's go inside.

20
00:05:09,910 --> 00:05:11,600
So, did you two have a long talk?

21
00:05:13,980 --> 00:05:16,860
All right then.
Let's discuss the conclusion.

22
00:05:17,610 --> 00:05:19,060
Who was in the wrong?

23
00:05:26,390 --> 00:05:27,900
Sit down, please.

24
00:05:29,470 --> 00:05:34,760
As for the son,
you know if things stay this way

25
00:05:34,760 --> 00:05:36,940
it's only a matter of time
before depression hits.

26
00:05:37,690 --> 00:05:41,150
Kim Haeng Ah, you always blame yourself
for everything.

27
00:05:41,150 --> 00:05:44,420
Then you will need treatment
for one more thing.

28
00:05:46,470 --> 00:05:48,870
Who was in the wrong and why did
things turn out this way?

29
00:05:49,860 --> 00:05:52,910
Perhaps, Doctor Park...

30
00:05:53,540 --> 00:05:55,600
Was it Sun Young who did something wrong?

31
00:05:55,600 --> 00:05:58,700
No, I don't think you should say that.

32
00:05:58,700 --> 00:06:02,500
But she opposed your relationship only
because of her past issues.

33
00:06:02,500 --> 00:06:04,890
From Aunt's point of view...

34
00:06:04,890 --> 00:06:08,070
Ah, since she raised her son
with so much difficulty on her own

35
00:06:08,100 --> 00:06:11,000
Sun Young is always right when it comes
to matters regarding her son?

36
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:13,690
It's just that if you think from
Aunt's point of view...

37
00:06:13,690 --> 00:06:16,800
You mean because she went through
hardship due to your father?

38
00:06:16,800 --> 00:06:20,390
So it doesn't anger you at all,
no matter how much she drives you away.

39
00:06:20,390 --> 00:06:24,040
Aunt was going through a great deal
of mental stress during that time.

40
00:06:24,040 --> 00:06:25,690
My dad and I were a disadvantage to her.

41
00:06:25,690 --> 00:06:28,190
Therefore, Sun Young's actions
were correct.

42
00:06:28,190 --> 00:06:33,190
So when it comes to her actions, I can't
be the one to say it is not right.

43
00:06:33,190 --> 00:06:37,390
If anyone should understand my aunt,
it should be me.

44
00:06:37,390 --> 00:06:40,160
So she was right to attempt suicide
and oppose you two?

45
00:06:40,190 --> 00:06:42,890
Because if my dad had not died,
she wouldn't be going through this!

46
00:06:42,890 --> 00:06:44,890
How hard must it be for her to see me?

47
00:06:44,890 --> 00:06:48,520
I knew it all and still I couldn't go
anywhere else.

48
00:06:48,520 --> 00:06:54,700
Every so often, I could see that she'd
look at me with eyes of fear, not hate.

49
00:06:54,720 --> 00:06:58,190
All I could do was smile like I didn't
know anything.

50
00:06:58,190 --> 00:06:59,690
So, Sun Young was right?

51
00:06:59,690 --> 00:07:02,560
No! That's not it!

52
00:07:29,930 --> 00:07:32,890
<i>There's understanding that something
is so hard you want to die.</i>

53
00:07:32,890 --> 00:07:35,390
<i>But that's different than thinking
it's okay to actually die.</i>

54
00:07:35,630 --> 00:07:40,630
<i>You can't cross on a red light just
since someone you love likes red lights.</i>

55
00:07:40,630 --> 00:07:44,170
<i>You shouldn't try to match two lives
to a wrong answer.</i>

56
00:07:50,890 --> 00:07:52,690
You're cold. Get going.

57
00:07:52,690 --> 00:07:53,690
I'm worried about you.

58
00:07:53,690 --> 00:07:57,500
Don't. Don't do things like that.
We shouldn't see each other.

59
00:07:57,500 --> 00:07:59,190
We can say Aunt is wrong.

60
00:07:59,190 --> 00:08:00,680
It doesn't change anything.

61
00:08:00,680 --> 00:08:03,800
I've been a burden to you this whole time
and you couldn't handle me.

62
00:08:03,800 --> 00:08:08,230
It's not you. Mom and I are the burden.

63
00:08:09,390 --> 00:08:12,570
If I hadn't brought you back
from Namhae that time

64
00:08:12,570 --> 00:08:16,920
you could have lived a happy life
just fine.

65
00:08:16,920 --> 00:08:21,040
You wouldn't need to worry about
being thrown away or about my mom.

66
00:08:21,040 --> 00:08:22,750
You wouldn't have had to live that way.

67
00:08:22,750 --> 00:08:28,470
Then I would have lived there alone,
washing my face until my skin wore off.

68
00:08:30,070 --> 00:08:31,670
You want to do this again?

69
00:08:32,910 --> 00:08:35,090
You want to cry from the beginning?

70
00:08:35,090 --> 00:08:36,790
I'll do it again if I have to.

71
00:08:37,600 --> 00:08:39,990
Unless this is because
you don't like me anymore

72
00:08:39,990 --> 00:08:42,490
I won't break up with you
for any other reason.

73
00:08:45,290 --> 00:08:48,080
Whether you have that gene or not...

74
00:08:56,500 --> 00:08:59,780
I'm not saying this thoughtlessly,
thinking there isn't a chance you might.

75
00:08:59,780 --> 00:09:02,030
I've been studying up on it a lot
all this time.

76
00:09:02,030 --> 00:09:04,890
You can find it early
and get treatment for it early.

77
00:09:04,890 --> 00:09:08,140
Just like a person with high
blood pressure or a bad heart.

78
00:09:08,140 --> 00:09:10,150
You can take medication and be careful.

79
00:09:10,150 --> 00:09:16,100
If we can finally say that Aunt is wrong
and it isn't helpful for me to be away.

80
00:09:16,100 --> 00:09:19,900
It does help. It's one less thing for
me to worry about if I don't see you.

81
00:09:19,900 --> 00:09:21,020
It's comfortable.

82
00:09:21,890 --> 00:09:25,870
All right. Then I'll wait more.

83
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:28,310
Drive carefully.

84
00:09:40,790 --> 00:09:43,100
Why are you causing such a fuss so early
in the morning?

85
00:09:43,100 --> 00:09:45,290
I'm going to hang
more pictures over there.

86
00:09:45,290 --> 00:09:46,890
Then just take photos of yourself.

87
00:09:46,890 --> 00:09:49,560
Then I'll be all alone.

88
00:09:49,560 --> 00:09:52,010
Why are you alone?
You're a daughter of this household.

89
00:09:52,010 --> 00:09:55,290
What good is that? It's all pictures of
Ri Hwan and Haeng Ah.

90
00:09:55,290 --> 00:09:57,860
Strangers will think I'm just still
an employee.

91
00:09:58,420 --> 00:10:00,160
Was that upsetting you?

92
00:10:02,700 --> 00:10:05,760
When that chair was thrown
and the frames were all freaking broken

93
00:10:05,790 --> 00:10:07,300
I should have thrown away
all the pictures.

94
00:10:07,300 --> 00:10:09,000
I told you not to say "freaking"!

95
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:10,900
Why are you hitting me?

96
00:10:10,900 --> 00:10:13,920
I cut my hands cleaning all that glass.

97
00:10:14,910 --> 00:10:18,130
Where is Sun Young and that Mister?

98
00:10:33,390 --> 00:10:36,300
What do I do about those two?

99
00:10:41,460 --> 00:10:43,600
Yes, come in.

100
00:10:47,790 --> 00:10:51,860
The PS1 gene is usually more common
in Caucasians.

101
00:10:52,840 --> 00:10:55,600
I'd like to know what's going
on beforehand.

102
00:10:55,600 --> 00:10:57,220
I can't exactly ask Doctor Park.

103
00:10:57,220 --> 00:11:00,640
Please keep it to yourself.

104
00:11:00,990 --> 00:11:02,110
Okay.

105
00:11:03,390 --> 00:11:06,790
No matter the results,
it's not like the skies are falling.

106
00:11:06,790 --> 00:11:08,000
You know that, right?

107
00:11:10,390 --> 00:11:11,390
Yes.

108
00:11:30,730 --> 00:11:31,830
You're here?

109
00:11:31,830 --> 00:11:33,140
Of course, why wouldn't I come?

110
00:11:33,140 --> 00:11:36,500
You look barely alive and you suddenly
went to the hospital on this cold day.

111
00:11:36,500 --> 00:11:38,770
And now you're drinking beer
at Han River during the day.

112
00:11:38,770 --> 00:11:44,130
I'm going to the store to buy one more.

113
00:11:44,700 --> 00:11:46,200
What's going on?

114
00:11:46,200 --> 00:11:47,950
Do you want a juice or something?

115
00:11:47,950 --> 00:11:50,090
Did you meet Ri Hwan at the hospital
or something?

116
00:11:50,510 --> 00:11:52,150
I'll be right back.

117
00:12:42,200 --> 00:12:44,500
I'm very sorry.

118
00:12:44,500 --> 00:12:46,320
As I explained to you

119
00:12:46,320 --> 00:12:50,010
she didn't mean to take a photo of
the two of you.

120
00:12:50,010 --> 00:12:52,860
I was teaching her how to take photos.

121
00:12:52,860 --> 00:12:54,670
She has a bad memory.

122
00:12:54,670 --> 00:12:57,720
She was just pressing this and that
and took a photo of you two.

123
00:12:57,720 --> 00:12:59,530
Please don't misunderstand.

124
00:13:00,430 --> 00:13:04,930
Sun Young, let's go upstairs to the
second floor. Okay?

125
00:13:06,530 --> 00:13:10,720
Does it makes sense that she doesn't
know what she's taking a picture of?

126
00:13:10,720 --> 00:13:12,890
I'm very sorry.

127
00:13:13,700 --> 00:13:16,150
She's kind of sick.

128
00:13:16,700 --> 00:13:18,690
I told you she can't remember things.

129
00:13:19,390 --> 00:13:26,790
She can't have bad intent even if she
wanted to, so please try to understand.

130
00:13:26,790 --> 00:13:29,100
Who would leave a sick person sitting
out here?

131
00:13:29,100 --> 00:13:31,010
And why give her a camera?

132
00:13:31,010 --> 00:13:33,820
Gosh, seriously! Here!

133
00:13:35,880 --> 00:13:38,060
She should sit with a flower in her hair.

134
00:13:42,840 --> 00:13:45,960
Just think of it like you stepped in
dog crap. Okay? Dog crap!

135
00:13:46,210 --> 00:13:47,350
Excuse me!

136
00:13:50,850 --> 00:13:53,630
I apologized. I told you she was sick.

137
00:13:53,630 --> 00:13:56,310
How could you refer to a person like that
with the word "crap"?

138
00:13:56,310 --> 00:13:59,050
I may have been ranked last in
school for three years.

139
00:13:59,050 --> 00:14:02,470
But I know that you don't call
people with illnesses names like that.

140
00:14:02,470 --> 00:14:05,790
How uneducated and ignorant are you
that you speak that way?

141
00:14:05,790 --> 00:14:08,710
Can you eat with that mouth
and actually digest your food!

142
00:14:08,710 --> 00:14:10,560
Who is the owner of this place? Huh!

143
00:14:10,560 --> 00:14:12,430
Bring the owner out here now!

144
00:14:16,500 --> 00:14:18,990
<i>Wait a minute. Wait.</i>

145
00:14:30,890 --> 00:14:33,360
Why are you crying?

146
00:14:35,100 --> 00:14:38,360
You'll lose your strength if you cry.
Let's stop crying.

147
00:14:40,740 --> 00:14:41,890
Where's Ri Hwan?

148
00:14:41,890 --> 00:14:43,600
Should I call Ri Hwan?

149
00:14:51,100 --> 00:14:53,390
We couldn't take a walk today.

150
00:14:53,390 --> 00:14:56,570
It's okay. I'll take her. Bye, Aunt.

151
00:14:56,570 --> 00:14:59,750
Before the nurse gets there,
make sure you...

152
00:15:01,790 --> 00:15:04,400
You're her son.
Why do I even bother worrying?

153
00:15:04,400 --> 00:15:06,230
- Get going now.
- Bye.

154
00:15:08,100 --> 00:15:10,370
See you tomorrow morning, Sun Young.

155
00:15:10,370 --> 00:15:12,860
Okay, see you tomorrow morning.

156
00:15:12,860 --> 00:15:13,900
Okay.

157
00:15:14,010 --> 00:15:16,080
<i>[Alzheimer's and dementia symptoms]</i>

158
00:15:21,700 --> 00:15:24,640
No wonder. Ri Hwan did break up with you
too easily.

159
00:15:24,640 --> 00:15:26,060
I thought it was strange!

160
00:15:26,060 --> 00:15:30,750
But you know that it can pass down
to him and you still won't break up?

161
00:15:30,750 --> 00:15:34,090
What's wrong with you?
Don't you value yourself at all?

162
00:15:35,290 --> 00:15:36,710
Give me my phone.

163
00:15:36,710 --> 00:15:37,930
I can't give it to you.

164
00:15:37,930 --> 00:15:40,890
You'll be living your life
looking at this and being a slave.

165
00:15:40,890 --> 00:15:42,790
Why should I watch you do that?

166
00:15:42,790 --> 00:15:47,700
It was worse for Aunt
because we found out too late.

167
00:15:47,700 --> 00:15:50,990
If it's treated from the beginning
so that the protein doesn't build

168
00:15:51,010 --> 00:15:53,270
some people can live a long life with
just forgetfulness symptoms.

169
00:15:53,270 --> 00:15:57,390
So what? You're going to wait it out
and make Ri Hwan better?

170
00:15:57,390 --> 00:16:02,200
Do you even realize how much scarier
the real world is outside of this screen?

171
00:16:02,200 --> 00:16:07,200
Alzheimer's is the kind of disease
that can drive an entire family crazy.

172
00:16:07,200 --> 00:16:10,030
Who is going to be next to you? Ri Hwan?

173
00:16:10,030 --> 00:16:12,800
But Ri Hwan is going to be sick
just like that.

174
00:16:12,800 --> 00:16:14,310
Do you have to talk like that?

175
00:16:14,310 --> 00:16:16,000
You're my friend.

176
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:20,290
Can't you, at least, tell me to stay
and stick through it?

177
00:16:20,290 --> 00:16:23,500
If I am your friend,
aren't you my friend too?

178
00:16:23,500 --> 00:16:26,330
Then at the very least, you shouldn't
have been looking at this in secret

179
00:16:26,360 --> 00:16:28,620
and pretended to be okay in front of me.

180
00:16:28,620 --> 00:16:31,730
You should have cried your eyes out
and gotten angry!

181
00:16:31,730 --> 00:16:34,120
I don't know who to get angry at.

182
00:16:34,120 --> 00:16:36,500
I'm angry at everyone! I hate everyone!

183
00:16:36,500 --> 00:16:38,540
The doctor says Aunt is wrong.

184
00:16:38,540 --> 00:16:40,770
Ri Hwan says it's all his fault.

185
00:16:40,770 --> 00:16:43,700
Aunt is sick and Ri Hwan is having
a harder time than me.

186
00:16:43,700 --> 00:16:46,860
You're angrier than I am because
you're worried about me.

187
00:16:46,860 --> 00:16:50,120
Then should I go get angry at the doctors
at the hospital?

188
00:16:50,120 --> 00:16:53,950
Why are you in those gowns if you can't
even help my mom, dad, or aunt?

189
00:16:53,950 --> 00:16:57,090
Or should I go to a church and get mad?
"Why are you doing this to me?"

190
00:16:57,090 --> 00:16:58,830
Should I go to a temple and shout?

191
00:16:58,830 --> 00:17:01,790
"Leave the people next to me alone!"

192
00:17:01,790 --> 00:17:03,670
Who am I supposed to get mad at?

193
00:17:03,670 --> 00:17:06,660
Everyone! Anyone!

194
00:17:07,700 --> 00:17:09,020
Even me...

195
00:17:29,290 --> 00:17:30,940
Do you have your gloves on?

196
00:17:30,940 --> 00:17:31,970
Yes.

197
00:17:31,970 --> 00:17:33,740
- Are you cold?
- No.

198
00:17:37,790 --> 00:17:39,300
Here, a present.

199
00:17:40,680 --> 00:17:43,420
- It's pretty.
- Mom, you are prettier.

200
00:17:47,740 --> 00:17:51,460
You bought me flowers back then
on my birthday.

201
00:17:52,900 --> 00:17:55,400
So I got angry at you.

202
00:17:56,700 --> 00:17:58,270
And you cried.

203
00:17:58,270 --> 00:18:00,790
You got angry at me?

204
00:18:00,790 --> 00:18:03,200
"Who told you to buy these?"

205
00:18:03,200 --> 00:18:05,700
"Don't you know we have to throw this
away when it dies?"

206
00:18:06,400 --> 00:18:08,870
Oh, you mean when I was in
elementary school?

207
00:18:09,400 --> 00:18:13,590
So, in order to keep it alive,
every day you put...

208
00:18:15,230 --> 00:18:17,200
something cold...

209
00:18:17,200 --> 00:18:20,250
That's right.
I put ice in the vase every day.

210
00:18:20,250 --> 00:18:23,440
The flower shop said that roses last
longer if you do that.

211
00:18:24,200 --> 00:18:27,200
You wrote "Happy Birthday" on the card.

212
00:18:27,200 --> 00:18:29,030
There were three P's.

213
00:18:29,400 --> 00:18:31,720
I told you to get an eraser.

214
00:18:33,400 --> 00:18:35,470
Then I told you to erase one of the P's.

215
00:18:36,500 --> 00:18:38,820
I could have let it be.

216
00:18:40,200 --> 00:18:41,850
You remember all of that.

217
00:18:42,980 --> 00:18:45,990
I had so much ambition, didn't I?

218
00:18:45,990 --> 00:18:49,770
No, you were a brave person.

219
00:18:49,770 --> 00:18:51,860
No one could have done what you did, Mom.

220
00:18:54,400 --> 00:18:56,850
I forgot something again, haven't I?

221
00:18:57,250 --> 00:18:58,400
What?

222
00:19:00,890 --> 00:19:02,770
I'm not sure what.

223
00:19:03,580 --> 00:19:04,900
It's all right.

224
00:19:12,400 --> 00:19:14,340
Mom, should we sit down for a bit?

225
00:19:16,410 --> 00:19:17,540
Here.

226
00:19:20,240 --> 00:19:21,880
It's so pretty.

227
00:19:22,390 --> 00:19:23,910
I'll buy you some every day.

228
00:19:24,530 --> 00:19:26,010
Should I hold them?

229
00:19:37,290 --> 00:19:38,500
Mom.

230
00:19:39,980 --> 00:19:43,650
Let's put your glove on this hand too.

231
00:19:48,520 --> 00:19:49,630
Here you go.

232
00:19:52,500 --> 00:19:57,230
There are 1000s of nerve cells
attached to one.

233
00:19:58,070 --> 00:20:00,770
There's not much you can do for one
that's already dead.

234
00:20:01,380 --> 00:20:04,750
If we keep stimulating the ones that
are still alive...

235
00:20:06,590 --> 00:20:11,350
we can slow down the process of you
losing things you can do on your own.

236
00:20:12,880 --> 00:20:14,110
That's all done.

237
00:20:21,220 --> 00:20:23,000
Haw far did I get again?

238
00:20:23,320 --> 00:20:24,470
With what?

239
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:28,120
Out of all the people
losing their memories

240
00:20:28,120 --> 00:20:30,900
I think I must be the happiest.

241
00:20:38,090 --> 00:20:40,650
I told you before too, right?

242
00:20:41,330 --> 00:20:42,490
No.

243
00:20:43,450 --> 00:20:45,960
This is the first time you've ever said
something like this.

244
00:20:46,550 --> 00:20:48,080
That you're happy...

245
00:20:49,180 --> 00:20:51,370
That I'm happy?

246
00:20:51,370 --> 00:20:54,890
Yes, that you are happy.

247
00:20:56,570 --> 00:20:58,750
The weather is so nice.

248
00:20:59,310 --> 00:21:01,340
And this is so pretty.

249
00:21:02,120 --> 00:21:04,900
So, you are happy?

250
00:21:05,450 --> 00:21:07,890
Where are we going now?

251
00:21:09,370 --> 00:21:10,920
We're going home.

252
00:21:11,460 --> 00:21:15,200
Not to the cold and sad home,
but the house that's warm.

253
00:21:17,050 --> 00:21:19,620
<i>In a world that is full of light</i>

254
00:21:19,620 --> 00:21:22,560
<i>the shadow that hung at your feet
was clear.</i>

255
00:21:35,200 --> 00:21:37,840
<i>In a world that had become dark</i>

256
00:21:37,840 --> 00:21:41,590
<i>the thin, weak ray of light
had become clear.</i>

257
00:21:43,080 --> 00:21:45,330
<i>A light that had been hidden in
a world of light.</i>

258
00:21:48,770 --> 00:21:52,220
<i>A new happiness that had been unknown
during times of happiness.</i>

259
00:21:55,480 --> 00:22:02,410
<i>While her memories faded,
perhaps she wanted me to know that.</i>

260
00:22:17,880 --> 00:22:21,010
I always felt like I needed someone.

261
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:26,030
Someone who liked me
more than I liked him.

262
00:22:26,030 --> 00:22:29,290
Someone I could show off to my friends.

263
00:22:29,290 --> 00:22:33,670
But those are all things I don't need.

264
00:22:35,360 --> 00:22:38,680
Those were all things I wanted because
I didn't have them.

265
00:22:39,400 --> 00:22:45,280
The people I really can't lose were
people who I already had.

266
00:22:52,450 --> 00:22:53,830
<i>[Older Brother]</i>

267
00:22:56,350 --> 00:22:58,470
- Jung Woo?
- <i>Open the door.</i>

268
00:22:58,470 --> 00:23:01,400
- I'm still at the hospital.
- <i>I know that.</i>

269
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:11,490
Jung Woo, what's going on?

270
00:23:11,490 --> 00:23:12,580
Let's go inside.

271
00:23:14,630 --> 00:23:19,580
Wow, you got a new painting.

272
00:23:20,310 --> 00:23:21,900
Also a new globe.

273
00:23:24,970 --> 00:23:28,510
Are you alone in a closed office
to avoid Mom?

274
00:23:28,510 --> 00:23:29,930
I wanted to read some books too.

275
00:23:29,930 --> 00:23:33,150
- Mom still barges in often?
- Yeah.

276
00:23:33,150 --> 00:23:35,570
- With marriage setup photos?
- Yeah.

277
00:23:35,570 --> 00:23:37,660
- And they're all ugly?
- Yes.

278
00:23:39,550 --> 00:23:43,910
Can't you filter out based on looks?
Why are they all ugly?

279
00:23:45,950 --> 00:23:50,080
Are you saying that my daughter would
match these ugly people?

280
00:23:50,080 --> 00:23:53,180
She can't do it to me,
so she's doing it to you.

281
00:23:53,180 --> 00:23:56,390
You're not going to get married again?

282
00:23:56,390 --> 00:23:59,370
I won't. Whoever it would be would
be pitiable.

283
00:24:00,410 --> 00:24:03,420
Unless I end up being reborn into
another family, that is.

284
00:24:03,420 --> 00:24:07,440
It would be nice
if you met a nice person.

285
00:24:09,930 --> 00:24:13,040
Mom came by my work on Wednesday.

286
00:24:13,510 --> 00:24:16,920
I thought a pink balloon witch
had burst in.

287
00:24:17,340 --> 00:24:19,980
She wore something similar this morning.

288
00:24:20,310 --> 00:24:22,930
Look at this. What kind of tie is this?

289
00:24:22,930 --> 00:24:24,500
They're all bums.

290
00:24:24,500 --> 00:24:28,690
Don't they have anyone to style them
when they're taking a photo?

291
00:24:28,690 --> 00:24:32,130
Where in the world is she buying
those clothes?

292
00:24:32,130 --> 00:24:34,570
- I'm not sure.
- Aren't you curious sometimes?

293
00:24:34,570 --> 00:24:38,890
How would Mom have lived if she hadn't
met Dad and married him?

294
00:24:38,890 --> 00:24:40,770
Like Mom said...

295
00:24:41,300 --> 00:24:44,690
I guess she would have been an actress
or something like that.

296
00:24:45,750 --> 00:24:50,350
If Mom had become a celebrity,
her manager would have died.

297
00:24:53,240 --> 00:24:56,000
If I freeze to death,
will you bring the car out on time then?

298
00:24:56,000 --> 00:24:59,100
How can you make me wait
every single time?

299
00:24:59,100 --> 00:25:00,190
I'm sorry.

300
00:25:00,190 --> 00:25:03,800
Do you have a utility pole in your ear
or an acorn for your brain?

301
00:25:03,800 --> 00:25:06,390
Why do you make me say that same thing
over and over?

302
00:25:06,390 --> 00:25:09,190
I try to take care of Driver Cho myself.

303
00:25:09,190 --> 00:25:11,560
Still, I feel sorry every time I see him.

304
00:25:13,760 --> 00:25:18,500
Yi Seul, you find Mom to be spiteful,
don't you?

305
00:25:19,430 --> 00:25:23,410
All her life, she was told to divorce for
being poor and marrying with nothing.

306
00:25:23,410 --> 00:25:26,620
She heard all of that and fought to
keep her spot in the family.

307
00:25:26,620 --> 00:25:30,560
You're being given all of that,
but you keep throwing it all away.

308
00:25:30,560 --> 00:25:32,000
Or...

309
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:37,270
Maybe Mom is just bored.

310
00:25:37,270 --> 00:25:41,550
She no longer has anything to fight for
or to protect.

311
00:25:41,550 --> 00:25:43,590
Where should I take you now?

312
00:25:43,590 --> 00:25:47,150
Well, the hotel?

313
00:25:47,720 --> 00:25:50,940
I have nothing to do there...
The house?

314
00:25:52,990 --> 00:25:55,020
No one will be there.

315
00:25:55,020 --> 00:25:58,660
The department store...
No, let's just go home.

316
00:25:59,520 --> 00:26:02,810
What about Yi Seul? Where is Yi Seul?

317
00:26:06,260 --> 00:26:11,050
What I'd really like to see is Mom
wearing pants above her knees.

318
00:26:11,050 --> 00:26:12,420
I don't want to.

319
00:26:12,420 --> 00:26:14,200
- Why?
- Just because.

320
00:26:14,200 --> 00:26:15,830
I think it would be weird.

321
00:26:15,830 --> 00:26:16,890
It would be weird.

322
00:26:16,890 --> 00:26:21,480
I just want Mom to be the way she is now.

323
00:26:22,210 --> 00:26:25,310
Not sick and not losing her confidence.

324
00:26:25,910 --> 00:26:29,240
I just wish she wouldn't be
so harsh on others.

325
00:26:29,880 --> 00:26:31,650
Besides that...

326
00:26:31,650 --> 00:26:33,520
<i>The customer is not available...</i>

327
00:26:33,520 --> 00:26:35,460
Why isn't she picking up her phone?

328
00:26:40,260 --> 00:26:45,490
By the way, is the air in this car dirty
or is it this cell phone?

329
00:26:46,650 --> 00:26:48,640
And why is my ear so itchy?

330
00:26:49,080 --> 00:26:55,060
Yi Seul, honestly, I didn't come here to
make fun of Mom with you.

331
00:26:55,370 --> 00:26:56,770
I heard something.

332
00:26:58,100 --> 00:27:00,660
I heard you looked into
an Alzheimer's hospital.

333
00:27:00,660 --> 00:27:04,310
If you heard about it,
then Mom must know about it too.

334
00:27:04,310 --> 00:27:05,650
I told her not to say anything.

335
00:27:06,600 --> 00:27:07,980
Thank you.

336
00:27:09,030 --> 00:27:13,760
Can you let go of that Eastern medicine
doctor now?

337
00:27:14,690 --> 00:27:17,220
- I think that there are...
- I've already thought to do that.

338
00:27:17,220 --> 00:27:19,860
I want to do that. I really want to stop.

339
00:27:21,560 --> 00:27:26,530
He says he doesn't need anything
and he told me to stop coming.

340
00:27:29,100 --> 00:27:33,890
But I held onto him tightly
and didn't let go.

341
00:27:35,680 --> 00:27:40,350
Jung Woo, he must find me so burdensome.

342
00:27:42,320 --> 00:27:44,830
He already has so many hardships.

343
00:27:45,760 --> 00:27:48,720
About that hospital you looked into...

344
00:28:01,280 --> 00:28:03,650
<i>Don't listen to me starting today.</i>

345
00:28:03,650 --> 00:28:05,730
<i>Don't listen to what I had said.</i>

346
00:28:06,600 --> 00:28:10,460
<i>Think only about what will make you
happy in your life.</i>

347
00:28:11,390 --> 00:28:12,790
<i>You can do that, right?</i>

348
00:28:14,720 --> 00:28:17,440
I just want you...

349
00:28:18,540 --> 00:28:21,100
not to suffer and be here.

350
00:28:21,100 --> 00:28:23,100
And call this place for me.

351
00:28:23,100 --> 00:28:24,410
I can't do that.

352
00:28:24,860 --> 00:28:27,040
I would have said that too if I were you.

353
00:28:27,040 --> 00:28:29,690
But what if you were me?

354
00:28:31,690 --> 00:28:35,460
No, let's not think about that stuff.

355
00:28:35,460 --> 00:28:36,620
Just...

356
00:28:37,900 --> 00:28:42,050
Can't you let me keep
my last bit of pride?

357
00:28:42,050 --> 00:28:47,600
I know it was stupid, but I spent
my whole life protecting that.

358
00:28:49,330 --> 00:28:51,530
Everyone who cares about you

359
00:28:51,530 --> 00:28:56,340
is all relieved that you didn't get
into a car accident.

360
00:28:56,860 --> 00:28:59,050
We're just grateful for that.

361
00:28:59,050 --> 00:29:00,390
It will get worse and worse.

362
00:29:00,390 --> 00:29:03,310
No, you will just get different.

363
00:29:05,400 --> 00:29:09,640
I won't feel heartache or pity you.

364
00:29:10,680 --> 00:29:14,750
As you keep changing,
I will treat you differently.

365
00:29:15,040 --> 00:29:18,960
As you forget all the difficult times
you've been through and feel at peace

366
00:29:18,960 --> 00:29:20,790
I'll feel at ease when I see you too.

367
00:29:21,910 --> 00:29:23,570
If you forget me

368
00:29:23,570 --> 00:29:27,380
I will tell you that I'm your upstairs
neighbor come down to visit.

369
00:29:28,760 --> 00:29:32,010
I am ready now.

370
00:29:33,770 --> 00:29:35,970
Bring me a pen and paper.

371
00:29:37,710 --> 00:29:39,600
Don't write things down.

372
00:29:39,600 --> 00:29:41,930
- I'll remember it.
- Bring them.

373
00:29:42,160 --> 00:29:44,420
Now. Hurry.

374
00:29:48,180 --> 00:29:51,430
<i>One, contact the sanatorium.</i>

375
00:29:51,430 --> 00:29:54,210
<i>Go to Senior Joon Hyuk.</i>

376
00:29:54,580 --> 00:29:56,090
<i>Pretty outfit...</i>

377
00:29:56,450 --> 00:29:58,880
<i>Haeng Ah, Haeng Ah...</i>

378
00:29:59,570 --> 00:30:02,910
<i>Three, let Ri Hwan go.</i>

379
00:30:03,270 --> 00:30:05,500
<i>Tell him I'm sorry.</i>

380
00:30:05,500 --> 00:30:09,190
<i>Vacation, the ocean.</i>

381
00:30:09,190 --> 00:30:10,840
<i>A faraway place.</i>

382
00:30:11,880 --> 00:30:13,430
<i>Field trip.</i>

383
00:30:14,720 --> 00:30:16,490
<i>That I'm sorry...</i>

384
00:30:17,810 --> 00:30:19,540
<i>That I'm sorry...</i>

385
00:30:20,200 --> 00:30:21,520
<i>Four.</i>

386
00:30:22,110 --> 00:30:27,240
<i>If I don't remember anything here,
listen to my recording on my phone.</i>

387
00:30:27,940 --> 00:30:29,430
<i>Five.</i>

388
00:30:29,430 --> 00:30:32,580
<i>Leave my cell phone under my pillow
at all times.</i>

389
00:30:32,580 --> 00:30:36,550
<i>Six, if I don't understand all of this...</i>

390
00:30:37,670 --> 00:30:39,990
<i>do not...</i>

391
00:30:41,360 --> 00:30:43,530
<i>do not say anything more to anyone.</i>

392
00:31:02,520 --> 00:31:05,420
<i>Out of all the people
losing their memories</i>

393
00:31:05,420 --> 00:31:07,990
<i>I think I must be the happiest.</i>

394
00:31:11,960 --> 00:31:15,890
Ah, this is nice!
How is it?

395
00:31:15,890 --> 00:31:19,260
It is pretty, but didn't they tell you
to just come?

396
00:31:19,690 --> 00:31:21,690
They just say that.

397
00:31:21,690 --> 00:31:24,760
"You can just come. No makeup is fine."

398
00:31:24,760 --> 00:31:27,300
Forget it. Makeup makes me prettier.

399
00:31:27,300 --> 00:31:28,760
Get in. Let's go.

400
00:31:38,870 --> 00:31:41,070
Get in. Let's go.

401
00:31:45,810 --> 00:31:48,550
"Travel back to a time when you had
your young skin."

402
00:31:48,550 --> 00:31:51,240
"The heroine of Nine Affairs."

403
00:31:51,260 --> 00:31:54,070
"Secret to youth by Oh Se Young."

404
00:31:54,800 --> 00:31:58,010
"I get insulted so much that
I do not age."

405
00:31:59,160 --> 00:32:00,580
Oh my goodness.

406
00:32:02,100 --> 00:32:04,900
Your eyes look great. They sparkle.

407
00:32:04,900 --> 00:32:07,650
I'll enjoy this.

408
00:32:08,080 --> 00:32:12,600
Well, I did promise.
I'll buy us dinner after the recording.

409
00:32:12,600 --> 00:32:16,300
Oh no, you must be tired after going
to the salon this morning.

410
00:32:16,300 --> 00:32:20,380
Forget it, just go and eat.
We do all this to live and eat.

411
00:32:24,740 --> 00:32:28,650
<i>When I was young, I looked to
the sky after doing a good deed.</i>

412
00:32:28,650 --> 00:32:31,510
You saw my good deed, didn't you, Santa?

413
00:32:31,510 --> 00:32:33,580
You weren't looking somewhere else,
were you?

414
00:32:33,580 --> 00:32:39,210
So when I found out my dad was Santa,
I was actually relieved.

415
00:32:39,210 --> 00:32:43,060
The anxiety I felt over those
pure and ambiguous things...

416
00:32:43,090 --> 00:32:44,930
I felt it even back then.

417
00:32:44,930 --> 00:32:46,890
Do I have to become an ambitious person?

418
00:32:46,890 --> 00:32:49,660
They're even recording on a Sunday?

419
00:32:50,450 --> 00:32:52,470
How much of a good person
do I have to be?

420
00:32:52,470 --> 00:32:55,270
How much money do I have to earn?

421
00:32:55,780 --> 00:32:58,620
But I no longer feel that ambiguous.

422
00:32:58,620 --> 00:33:01,970
I know just how much happiness I want.

423
00:33:01,970 --> 00:33:06,220
There's a person by my side
and I think that's enough for me.

424
00:33:07,000 --> 00:33:09,900
Oh, I understand that very well.

425
00:33:09,900 --> 00:33:11,720
Am I the only one here who understands?

426
00:33:12,890 --> 00:33:14,260
Well, I'll continue reading.

427
00:33:14,260 --> 00:33:18,660
Se Young, that's why I'm writing in.
I'm getting married.

428
00:33:18,660 --> 00:33:20,300
Please congratulate me.

429
00:33:22,160 --> 00:33:24,670
Congratulations. Let's go to commercial.

430
00:33:27,390 --> 00:33:30,100
Commercial. We are going to commercial!

431
00:33:34,390 --> 00:33:36,600
It says here that we are going to hear
a song request.

432
00:33:36,600 --> 00:33:39,760
What, what, what? It's up to me.

433
00:33:39,760 --> 00:33:42,330
She's funny. Why ask me to
congratulate her on her marriage?

434
00:33:42,330 --> 00:33:45,720
Then should she ask the 8:00 p.m. news
to do it?

435
00:33:45,720 --> 00:33:48,110
Isn't there anything else besides this?

436
00:33:48,110 --> 00:33:50,450
- Like someone dying of loneliness?
- No.

437
00:33:50,450 --> 00:33:54,500
Only the ones asking us to congratulate
"brothers" on their comeback.

438
00:33:55,000 --> 00:33:57,210
If this were live,
we could receive texts.

439
00:33:57,210 --> 00:34:01,340
All because of my drama and commercial
shoot. I'm just too popular.

440
00:34:17,210 --> 00:34:20,050
<i>I contacted you very suddenly.
Thank you for coming.</i>

441
00:34:20,720 --> 00:34:24,720
I was going to send you the paperwork,
but I wanted to see your hospital.

442
00:34:25,380 --> 00:34:27,570
My mother wanted to get rid of
this place.

443
00:34:27,570 --> 00:34:29,000
That's a problem.

444
00:34:29,580 --> 00:34:31,160
This is my senior's hospital.

445
00:34:31,160 --> 00:34:32,250
That's even better.

446
00:34:32,250 --> 00:34:37,340
To a person like you, it's more effective
to bother your friends than you.

447
00:34:37,340 --> 00:34:39,940
If you want something, tell me.

448
00:34:39,940 --> 00:34:44,690
Yi Seul likes you and you don't.

449
00:34:44,690 --> 00:34:48,310
So I thought about what I could do.

450
00:34:49,490 --> 00:34:50,830
All I could think of was...

451
00:34:53,460 --> 00:34:56,250
kidnapping, forcefully detain, threaten,
or bribe.

452
00:34:56,930 --> 00:34:59,290
Or assault like I showed you last time.

453
00:34:59,290 --> 00:35:02,070
You said you had something to say to me.

454
00:35:08,140 --> 00:35:10,150
There's a business card and a credit card
inside.

455
00:35:10,570 --> 00:35:13,370
It is everything I could find out about
your mother's illness.

456
00:35:14,170 --> 00:35:17,020
So it will be the best in the world.

457
00:35:17,020 --> 00:35:18,720
All you need to do is make one call.

458
00:35:18,720 --> 00:35:22,410
There will be a house ready to live in
and someone to help you.

459
00:35:22,410 --> 00:35:25,800
A car to take you to the airport
and even a toothbrush.

460
00:35:25,800 --> 00:35:28,000
I assume you know how to use
a credit card.

461
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:32,070
I have no reason to accept this,
and there will be no reason I would.

462
00:35:32,070 --> 00:35:38,340
I want my sister
to marry the man she loves.

463
00:35:38,340 --> 00:35:39,610
More than that...

464
00:35:40,550 --> 00:35:44,630
I want her to marry someone
who loves her.

465
00:35:45,150 --> 00:35:47,870
If you can't change to be that person...

466
00:35:48,900 --> 00:35:52,440
why don't you go somewhere where
you will not be seen?

467
00:35:53,370 --> 00:35:54,660
For example...

468
00:35:58,560 --> 00:36:03,540
a place where neither I nor Yi Seul can
suddenly appear like this.

469
00:36:06,840 --> 00:36:09,800
I would like to wait for your answer,
but I don't have the time.

470
00:36:09,800 --> 00:36:12,120
Please contact me when you have
the answer.

471
00:36:13,100 --> 00:36:15,960
Don't refuse right away and think
for a few days.

472
00:36:16,270 --> 00:36:19,330
It's not just about you,
but about your mother.

473
00:36:19,330 --> 00:36:20,840
You should think about it carefully.

474
00:36:49,830 --> 00:36:52,330
Hey, man. Hey, hey!

475
00:36:52,350 --> 00:36:56,190
You've got no fear.
What are you doing walking in here?

476
00:36:56,190 --> 00:36:59,070
What if you get unlucky and bump into
the president on his way out?

477
00:36:59,070 --> 00:37:02,460
There will be another world war
right on the spot.

478
00:37:02,460 --> 00:37:04,200
His office lights were turned off.

479
00:37:04,200 --> 00:37:06,840
Do you think people won't recognize
your face?

480
00:37:06,840 --> 00:37:10,040
You're suddenly talking a lot more
and you've gotten so strange lately.

481
00:37:10,040 --> 00:37:12,530
Let's get out of here. Let's go!

482
00:37:15,220 --> 00:37:18,410
- Oh my, hello!
- Hello.

483
00:37:18,780 --> 00:37:23,030
Weren't you fired from this place?

484
00:37:23,030 --> 00:37:25,060
Can you just come in like this?

485
00:37:25,800 --> 00:37:27,480
It was the weekend, so I thought you
wouldn't be here.

486
00:37:27,480 --> 00:37:29,300
We had a recording to do.

487
00:37:29,300 --> 00:37:31,110
You're all heading out together.

488
00:37:31,110 --> 00:37:33,960
Se Young's buying dinner.
She did a commercial.

489
00:37:33,960 --> 00:37:35,050
Oh, congratulations.

490
00:37:35,050 --> 00:37:38,260
If you were planning on dinner,
why don't you join us? It's on me.

491
00:37:38,260 --> 00:37:39,810
Why would you buy?

492
00:37:40,810 --> 00:37:43,780
Honestly, I find this a bit burdensome.

493
00:37:43,780 --> 00:37:46,470
I don't mind you being a fan,
but that's it.

494
00:37:46,470 --> 00:37:49,180
Yeah, why are you making an offer
that burdens people?

495
00:37:49,180 --> 00:37:51,370
Why would people eat dinner with
their bosses?

496
00:37:51,370 --> 00:37:53,080
You can all go now. Let's go.

497
00:37:53,080 --> 00:37:57,110
Oh, come on! He did come all this way.

498
00:37:57,110 --> 00:37:59,220
Let's go together. Let's go.

499
00:38:00,600 --> 00:38:03,410
We did agree to eat together often.
Let's go.

500
00:38:10,990 --> 00:38:13,510
Did you even go into work today? Did you?

501
00:38:14,170 --> 00:38:16,800
You're getting more lax these days.

502
00:38:16,800 --> 00:38:19,030
Before you know it,
you'll have a ponytail like me.

503
00:38:30,390 --> 00:38:31,410
Eat.

504
00:38:35,750 --> 00:38:39,390
Oh, I'm all right. I'll cut my own.

505
00:38:39,390 --> 00:38:43,160
Or someone else can do it for me,
but I don't think you ought to.

506
00:38:43,160 --> 00:38:45,450
Yes, please enjoy your food.

507
00:38:46,280 --> 00:38:48,600
You see that? I'm an iron wall.

508
00:38:48,600 --> 00:38:50,440
- Oh yes.
- Come on now!

509
00:38:50,440 --> 00:38:53,630
Wow, Channel Korea must be
a great company.

510
00:38:53,630 --> 00:38:58,420
CBM must have done something wrong.
You changed so much, right, right?

511
00:38:59,690 --> 00:39:01,870
Never mind. You just eat.

512
00:39:02,930 --> 00:39:04,700
Did you look into a new place?

513
00:39:04,700 --> 00:39:07,700
No, I'm still waiting. I couldn't find a
monthly rent.

514
00:39:07,700 --> 00:39:10,290
If you're free after dinner,
I can look with you after we eat.

515
00:39:12,060 --> 00:39:14,470
Senior, I told you back then...

516
00:39:14,470 --> 00:39:19,340
I know, but people's feelings don't
always go according to their plans.

517
00:39:20,760 --> 00:39:22,490
Don't draw a line to keep me out.

518
00:39:23,980 --> 00:39:25,650
<i>Let's start from the very beginning.</i>

519
00:39:25,650 --> 00:39:28,400
If we were to do this again,
I think I could be good at it.

520
00:39:29,700 --> 00:39:32,860
Not at the things that are urgent,
but the important things...

521
00:39:33,860 --> 00:39:34,880
Starting with you.

522
00:39:39,360 --> 00:39:43,210
Starting from the beginning is nice.

523
00:39:43,720 --> 00:39:49,890
From the beginning, you were amazing,
handsome, and someone I wanted to know.

524
00:39:50,300 --> 00:39:54,380
But if we were to start over again...

525
00:39:55,570 --> 00:40:00,730
The part where my heart beats like crazy
when I look at you

526
00:40:00,730 --> 00:40:05,360
and approaching you first with
no shame and asking you to feed me.

527
00:40:05,980 --> 00:40:07,880
None of that will happen.

528
00:40:09,620 --> 00:40:11,100
Will that be okay with you?

529
00:40:12,370 --> 00:40:16,280
If you really are nothing to me

530
00:40:16,280 --> 00:40:20,770
I could treat you like Manager Cho and
ask you to buy me drinks when I'm down.

531
00:40:20,770 --> 00:40:24,390
Or ask you to buy me yummy food.

532
00:40:26,780 --> 00:40:30,780
But you can't be
that kind of person to me.

533
00:40:31,350 --> 00:40:36,410
Even when I see you on TV,
I still think you're so handsome.

534
00:40:37,330 --> 00:40:39,600
And I'm so proud of you.

535
00:40:41,470 --> 00:40:44,490
Senior, I...

536
00:40:45,680 --> 00:40:47,800
only have one heart.

537
00:41:28,580 --> 00:41:30,060
Okay, let's meet.

538
00:41:30,390 --> 00:41:32,140
No, you don't need to come inside.

539
00:41:32,140 --> 00:41:34,360
You know that place
by the front entrance?

540
00:41:34,590 --> 00:41:36,750
Yes, the place we met last time.

541
00:42:09,310 --> 00:42:13,410
<i>When she said she likes someone else...
Wow!</i>

542
00:42:13,410 --> 00:42:17,600
I wanted to stick my finger down my
throat and vomit all the alcohol I had.

543
00:42:17,600 --> 00:42:19,130
I wanted to turn back time.

544
00:42:19,130 --> 00:42:20,700
That could happen.

545
00:42:22,760 --> 00:42:25,260
I've realized that as I've lived life.

546
00:42:25,260 --> 00:42:28,710
You think you'll have another chance
and another chance.

547
00:42:29,130 --> 00:42:30,450
"She is the one."

548
00:42:31,460 --> 00:42:32,790
"This is for real."

549
00:42:32,790 --> 00:42:35,430
You only feel that sure about something
a few times.

550
00:42:35,690 --> 00:42:36,910
That's what I'm saying.

551
00:42:36,910 --> 00:42:39,430
If I knew earlier,
I would have been good to her.

552
00:43:03,460 --> 00:43:04,920
Yes, yes.

553
00:43:05,910 --> 00:43:06,990
Yes.

554
00:43:08,560 --> 00:43:11,950
No, I don't think that would be
a good idea.

555
00:44:14,390 --> 00:44:16,820
This isn't the cafe in front of
the office.

556
00:44:47,280 --> 00:44:51,320
You can't take money with you in death,
but some people like people for money.

557
00:44:51,320 --> 00:44:55,260
It's not you can live off of looks,
but there are people who fall for looks.

558
00:44:56,050 --> 00:44:57,800
Yeah, you are right.

559
00:44:57,800 --> 00:44:59,950
There is no reason for liking a person.

560
00:45:00,380 --> 00:45:02,890
Whether you sympathize
with them or what

561
00:45:02,890 --> 00:45:04,900
if you like them, you just do.

562
00:45:05,520 --> 00:45:07,510
- But...
- But what?

563
00:45:09,800 --> 00:45:11,630
I don't dislike you.

564
00:45:11,630 --> 00:45:13,360
I have no reason to.

565
00:45:13,990 --> 00:45:18,810
I find you really interesting and I find
it interesting that you're doing this.

566
00:45:18,810 --> 00:45:22,590
I wonder to myself if something like this
will ever happen to me again.

567
00:45:23,820 --> 00:45:26,990
Will spring ever come for me again?

568
00:45:27,530 --> 00:45:30,000
It's not that I haven't thought
these things.

569
00:45:30,830 --> 00:45:32,490
But it hasn't gone any further.

570
00:45:34,300 --> 00:45:37,550
Just like spring,
I felt an odd sensation.

571
00:45:38,050 --> 00:45:41,410
I felt good and sad.

572
00:45:44,280 --> 00:45:45,750
That's all it was for me.

573
00:46:00,270 --> 00:46:01,420
Open it.

574
00:46:01,420 --> 00:46:04,290
If you're going to say you have no money
or no house...

575
00:46:05,870 --> 00:46:06,920
Open it.

576
00:46:20,380 --> 00:46:25,240
I don't like you enough to cover that up
with a picture of you.

577
00:46:26,920 --> 00:46:28,330
That's very important.

578
00:46:30,100 --> 00:46:32,190
I don't really want it.

579
00:46:32,780 --> 00:46:34,770
Just to have it once...

580
00:46:36,390 --> 00:46:38,150
That would just be greed.

581
00:46:39,370 --> 00:46:41,690
I don't want to live like that.

582
00:46:54,630 --> 00:46:55,840
Excuse me.

583
00:46:58,530 --> 00:46:59,770
Excuse me.

584
00:47:00,520 --> 00:47:05,060
I'm sorry, but it's the weekend
and we close at 9:00 p.m.

585
00:47:07,680 --> 00:47:09,210
- Okay.
- Thanks.

586
00:48:47,760 --> 00:48:49,310
Why did you bother coming back?

587
00:48:50,050 --> 00:48:52,080
I know you didn't come here to meet me.

588
00:48:52,550 --> 00:48:55,660
I only came in case no one came
and you'd wait all night.

589
00:48:57,490 --> 00:48:59,340
If you didn't get stood up,
then that's good.

590
00:49:03,370 --> 00:49:04,930
You're okay, right?

591
00:49:14,480 --> 00:49:17,950
I'm always the one who suffers. Just me.

592
00:49:20,400 --> 00:49:21,690
Thanks.

593
00:49:22,610 --> 00:49:25,470
I'm going to have coffee now.
Do you want some milk?

594
00:49:25,470 --> 00:49:26,720
I have strawberry milk.

595
00:49:26,720 --> 00:49:29,480
Am I a child? I'm having coffee too.

596
00:49:29,480 --> 00:49:30,660
Mild?

597
00:49:30,660 --> 00:49:33,650
No, very dark.

598
00:49:46,100 --> 00:49:47,580
Did you eat?

599
00:49:47,580 --> 00:49:50,170
I work at a restaurant. Of course I ate.

600
00:49:51,160 --> 00:49:53,220
- How about you?
- I ate.

601
00:49:53,590 --> 00:49:55,160
Then why is your face that way?

602
00:49:56,300 --> 00:49:57,340
Why?

603
00:49:57,340 --> 00:50:01,150
Don't you look in the mirror?
Where is all your fat?

604
00:50:01,500 --> 00:50:03,390
I put it in the drawer.

605
00:50:03,390 --> 00:50:05,040
I'll take it out soon.

606
00:50:05,850 --> 00:50:08,060
You're both skin and bones.

607
00:50:14,020 --> 00:50:17,260
You can have Ri Hwan, by the way.

608
00:50:17,260 --> 00:50:18,550
I'm done with him.

609
00:50:25,430 --> 00:50:29,400
He's not so great.
How can he break up with you first?

610
00:50:29,830 --> 00:50:32,110
If he likes you,
he should go to hell and back with you.

611
00:50:32,110 --> 00:50:33,670
Isn't that what a man should do?

612
00:50:35,220 --> 00:50:36,480
I'm disappointed in him.

613
00:50:36,480 --> 00:50:39,700
It's not like that.
There are things you don't know.

614
00:50:39,700 --> 00:50:41,350
I know everything.

615
00:50:42,300 --> 00:50:45,950
I heard his mom didn't like you.
So what about that?

616
00:50:45,950 --> 00:50:49,380
So what if you have a hard time because
of her? What's the big deal?

617
00:50:49,830 --> 00:50:53,930
"You're having a hard time."
And then he can give you a hug.

618
00:50:54,390 --> 00:50:58,090
This is all because he doesn't like
you enough.

619
00:50:58,090 --> 00:51:00,080
Because he can live without seeing you.

620
00:51:01,450 --> 00:51:03,420
That's not what it is.

621
00:51:04,450 --> 00:51:08,590
Ri Hwan's not worried about what's been
going on now.

622
00:51:09,140 --> 00:51:11,590
He's worried about the future.

623
00:51:13,340 --> 00:51:15,790
I would have done what Ri Hwan did.

624
00:51:16,610 --> 00:51:17,980
What is this?

625
00:51:18,520 --> 00:51:21,390
I was going to insult him with you.
Why are you taking his side?

626
00:51:21,920 --> 00:51:24,070
If I were Ri Hwan...

627
00:51:26,050 --> 00:51:28,390
If I happened to be Ri Hwan...

628
00:51:29,450 --> 00:51:32,060
Unless this is because
you don't like me anymore

629
00:51:32,060 --> 00:51:34,450
I won't break up with you
for any other reason.

630
00:51:36,920 --> 00:51:39,850
Whether you have that gene or not...

631
00:51:44,600 --> 00:51:46,950
If I were Ri Hwan...

632
00:51:50,100 --> 00:51:52,490
And I really were like that...

633
00:51:56,130 --> 00:51:58,300
I think I would run away.

634
00:52:01,120 --> 00:52:03,430
To a place where I could never find him.

635
00:52:10,110 --> 00:52:11,690
Dong Hwa, you can go on your own,
right?

636
00:52:13,050 --> 00:52:15,330
Are you telling me to leave now?

637
00:52:15,330 --> 00:52:18,650
You can take your time.
Look around to see if you want anything.

638
00:52:18,650 --> 00:52:19,780
You can take it.

639
00:52:27,540 --> 00:52:28,710
Are you home?

640
00:52:28,710 --> 00:52:30,670
Yeah, nothing's up, right?

641
00:52:30,670 --> 00:52:32,070
Of course not.

642
00:52:32,070 --> 00:52:35,240
Is there anything to eat?
I'm so cold and hungry.

643
00:52:35,240 --> 00:52:37,290
- You didn't eat?
- Did you?

644
00:52:39,400 --> 00:52:41,600
Gosh, I knew you wouldn't have.

645
00:52:41,600 --> 00:52:44,300
What should we eat?
It's too late to order.

646
00:52:47,300 --> 00:52:49,530
Why didn't you eat this whole time?

647
00:52:49,970 --> 00:52:51,940
We were talking and it just worked out
that way.

648
00:52:53,100 --> 00:52:54,510
Your face doesn't look good.

649
00:52:56,030 --> 00:52:58,380
What about you with your
good-looking face?

650
00:52:58,800 --> 00:53:00,340
You're better looking.

651
00:53:00,340 --> 00:53:01,720
I know that.

652
00:53:06,450 --> 00:53:10,080
It's been with the extra work, right?
I haven't been at the hospital much.

653
00:53:10,080 --> 00:53:11,260
Be quiet.

654
00:53:12,130 --> 00:53:14,710
Have you called that place?
The sanatorium?

655
00:53:17,000 --> 00:53:19,250
Mom had even put down a contract deposit.

656
00:53:19,670 --> 00:53:22,340
It was the day we were making kimchi
at the store.

657
00:53:23,620 --> 00:53:25,870
It's her personality to do that.

658
00:53:28,990 --> 00:53:30,640
I just can't do it.

659
00:53:31,850 --> 00:53:36,130
If the store family keeps helping out,
I'd like to continue on like this.

660
00:53:37,090 --> 00:53:38,970
Am I being too selfish?

661
00:53:40,290 --> 00:53:44,240
I know you'll say "no,"
but you're having a hard time too.

662
00:53:45,690 --> 00:53:48,080
What would you have said
if this was my dad?

663
00:53:48,830 --> 00:53:51,180
Would you have turned away
if this was Aunt Princess?

664
00:53:51,610 --> 00:53:54,920
This is something we all should pitch in
on and you've taken on the hardest role.

665
00:53:55,430 --> 00:53:56,700
Don't get weak now.

666
00:54:00,020 --> 00:54:02,210
- Buy this.
- Okay.

667
00:54:06,850 --> 00:54:10,100
Your mom would have said something
if she knew we ate ramen.

668
00:54:12,690 --> 00:54:17,440
Not listening to Mom
and that it could be right...

669
00:54:18,230 --> 00:54:19,800
it still feels awkward.

670
00:54:21,110 --> 00:54:23,260
I feel like I'm lying to Mom.

671
00:54:28,930 --> 00:54:30,410
Don't be alarmed.

672
00:54:30,410 --> 00:54:33,490
If it was your mom,
they would have called. I'll get it.

673
00:54:42,480 --> 00:54:45,140
- Haeng Ah.
- Senior, is Ri Hwan here?

674
00:54:45,140 --> 00:54:46,820
Oh, come in.

675
00:54:56,010 --> 00:54:59,740
What I said earlier today,
did you by chance...

676
00:55:00,750 --> 00:55:02,810
I thought you might get a test for that.

677
00:55:02,810 --> 00:55:04,130
Don't do it.

678
00:55:04,730 --> 00:55:08,830
I thought you wouldn't answer if I called
and you would delete my texts.

679
00:55:09,430 --> 00:55:12,320
Ji Hoon, I'm going out. I'll be back.

680
00:55:13,300 --> 00:55:14,800
Senior, can you hold onto Ri Hwan?

681
00:55:14,800 --> 00:55:16,220
Okay.

682
00:55:16,220 --> 00:55:20,470
If it is right then I think Ri Hwan is
going to run away where I can't find him.

683
00:55:26,910 --> 00:55:28,760
You didn't already do it, did you?

684
00:55:29,340 --> 00:55:31,420
That's not why you're acting this way,
is it?

685
00:55:32,600 --> 00:55:34,250
Senior...

686
00:55:34,780 --> 00:55:36,080
I don't know either.

687
00:55:40,280 --> 00:55:41,860
You did get the test done.

688
00:55:41,860 --> 00:55:43,260
Ri Hwan, did you really?

689
00:55:45,100 --> 00:55:46,650
Hey, Park Ri Hwan.

690
00:55:49,910 --> 00:55:51,970
I don't know the results yet.

691
00:55:54,320 --> 00:55:57,310
He doesn't know the results yet
and, Haeng Ah, even if it's positive...

692
00:55:57,310 --> 00:55:58,800
Senior, I know.

693
00:55:59,480 --> 00:56:02,700
While I haven't seen him,
I've been researching the entire time.

694
00:56:02,700 --> 00:56:03,850
Oh really?

695
00:56:04,920 --> 00:56:07,330
- Then I'll be outside for a bit.
- Ji Hoon.

696
00:56:09,200 --> 00:56:11,260
You don't need to. I'll leave.

697
00:56:11,260 --> 00:56:14,590
I'm leaving soon, but...

698
00:56:16,680 --> 00:56:21,170
If someone came to me when I was five
and told me

699
00:56:21,170 --> 00:56:26,270
you will lose your mother soon
and your father ten years later.

700
00:56:26,270 --> 00:56:29,370
If someone told me that,
then I wouldn't have been able to live.

701
00:56:30,040 --> 00:56:34,220
If someone came to me at 15 and told me
you will lose your father soon

702
00:56:34,220 --> 00:56:37,690
and in 20 years your aunt will lose
her memories.

703
00:56:37,690 --> 00:56:40,830
Even if someone said that,
I wouldn't have been able to live.

704
00:56:41,940 --> 00:56:44,800
<i>But I'm living perfectly well right now.</i>

705
00:56:44,800 --> 00:56:46,900
<i>I'm going to work and eating well.</i>

706
00:56:46,900 --> 00:56:50,960
<i>I'm smiling and even now, I miss you
and want to hold you.</i>

707
00:56:51,730 --> 00:56:57,110
<i>So now, I'm not afraid of anything
that could happen to me.</i>

708
00:56:58,470 --> 00:57:02,310
After my mom left me,
I met you and Aunt.

709
00:57:03,250 --> 00:57:06,570
After my dad left me,
I lived with you and Aunt.

710
00:57:06,570 --> 00:57:09,410
I fought and played with you.

711
00:57:09,410 --> 00:57:13,190
I was dying of sadness,
but somehow I got through those times.

712
00:57:13,190 --> 00:57:17,660
Ten or twenty years from now,
no matter what happens to me

713
00:57:17,660 --> 00:57:20,310
I am going to be living well.

714
00:57:21,620 --> 00:57:23,760
Just like I have been all this time.

715
00:57:25,730 --> 00:57:27,620
As long as you are by my side.

716
00:57:45,020 --> 00:57:46,450
<i>Hurry up and go to her.</i>

717
00:57:47,070 --> 00:57:49,800
I know you two will find your way
back to each other.

718
00:57:50,890 --> 00:57:54,460
But the longer you stay apart,
the deeper the wounds become.

719
00:57:55,060 --> 00:57:57,190
You shouldn't be doing that to Haeng Ah.

720
00:57:57,640 --> 00:57:59,170
Maybe I shouldn't be saying this.

721
00:57:59,780 --> 00:58:01,550
You doing this right now...

722
00:58:01,550 --> 00:58:03,770
You're making the same mistake
your mother did.

723
00:58:06,080 --> 00:58:08,960
You're hurting her just to protect her.

724
01:00:31,680 --> 01:00:35,200
I'm here now.

midnight anymore.</i>

728

<i>Did you run into him, meet him,
or decide to date him?</i>

729
01:01:52,080 --> 01:01:53,310
<i>The third one.</i>

730
01:01:53,310 --> 01:01:56,030
<i>You are returning everything?</i>

731
01:01:56,030 --> 01:01:58,160
<i>I'm here to say my last farewell.</i>

732
01:01:58,160 --> 01:02:00,620
<i>Aren't you scared of the future?</i>

733
01:02:00,620 --> 01:02:03,760
<i>I have someone with me
and I know where I'm headed.</i>

734
01:02:03,760 --> 01:02:04,920
<i>I'm not scared anymore.</i>

735
01:02:04,920 --> 01:02:07,200
<i>It was you in the end. It was all you!</i>

736
01:02:07,200 --> 01:02:10,260
<i>Stop playing around and grill some meat!</i>

737
01:02:11,580 --> 01:02:13,620
<i>I told you. It's nice.</i>
